# Installation UAC Bypass v2.0.5
Bypasses User Account Control when trying to install a program on Windows.

## THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! DO NOT USE THIS ON SOMEONE ELSE'S PC WITHOUT THEIR EXPLICIT PERMISSION! THIS IS A HACK! CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK! @YONATANTREUVENISRAELI HOLDS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED, IS HAPPENING, AND/OR WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THIS BATCH FILE!

## Notes
- By entering `"%windir%\regedit.exe"` it can allow a non-administrator to view the Windows Registry (you won't be able to edit the Windows Registry though).  
- You can only install a program using this batch file for the user you are logged in to.  
- When entering the path do not use quotes or double quotes if the installation file has a space in its name.  
- This will not work for every program. Examples include but are not limited to, programs that don't let you change the installation folder.
