# Installation UAC Bypass
## This batch file, named "Installation UAC Bypass.bat", is designed for educational purposes only to demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in Windows operating systems. It should only be used in controlled testing environments with explicit authorization.
Bypasses User Account Control when trying to install a program on Windows.
## Note:
By entering "Your Windows Directory (%windir% won't work for some reason)"\regedit.exe it can allow a non-administrator to view the Windows Registry Editor (you won't be able to edit the Windows Registry Editor though).
